# PowerCo_Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
## PowerCo - Churn Analysis and Prediction project is to identify the source of churning customers in the power market and understand the impact of pricing changes on customer churn and to predict which customers are more likely to churn at their current prices.



## Problem Statement:


The objective of this project is to analyze and predict power churn for a utility company in order to reduce customer churn and improve customer satisfaction.
Power churn is defined as the rate at which customers switch to a different electricity provider.By analyzing customer data and identifying factors that contribute to churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates.
Using machine learning algorithms and predictive models, the company can forecast which customers are likely to churn and take targeted actions to prevent it.


## Summary:


The dataset contains customer data for a power utility company, including demographic information, billing and payment details, and service usage. The dataset also includes a churn label indicating whether the customer has churned or not. The data covers a period of several years and includes over 14,000 customer records.

The data requires cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to identify patterns and relationships in the data. Feature engineering techniques will be used to extract relevant information from the data and create new features.As well as necessary sampling technique is also used to get a balanced result rather than biased.

The analysis involves using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees,SVC, and random forests.The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.The best-performing model will be selected for use in predicting customer churn rates.

The insights gained from this analysis can help the power utility company understand customer behavior and implement strategies to reduce churn rates.
